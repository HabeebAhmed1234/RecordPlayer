# RecordPlayer

RecordPlayer is a beautiful no frills Music Playing App! The whole app fits on one page so that It gives you the music you want to listen to when you want it. No fumbling around with options and endless menus unlike some apps we know (*cough* google play music *cough*).

RecordPlayer also leverages unique android features to make the app's theme warp and change to reflect the music you're listening to. 
It also uses things like coordinator layouts, collapsing toolbars, blur effects, card views and much more to deliver the most functionality in the most minimal amount of UI.

The focus here is on functionality with design.

Make feature requests to my email address. Any and all feedback is appreciated!
